<h2>What is Open Mentor?</h2>

<p>
  The teaching model underlying the system recognises that
  students need an explicit level of socio-emotive support as well
  as direct instruction.  It recommends tutors praise the student
  for their achievement.  Point out mistakes in a constructive
  manner and offer explicit direction for student improvement in a
  specific piece of work and for future assignments.  It is
  especially important that the feedback students receive from
  teaching staff provides both the subject specific guidance they
  require and the support they need for further
  development. Initial research showed (see Whitelock et al 2004)
  that there was convincing evidence of systematic connections
  between different types of tutor comments and level of
  attainment in assessment and this was the platform for the
  development of OpenMentor.

<h3>How does it work in practice?</h3>
<p>
  OpenMentor analyses the tutors comments and sifts them to see if
  the underlying teaching model applies.  In fact there are four
  major categories that capture the activities of teaching using
  this modus operandi; which are positive reactions, negative
  reactions, questions posed to the student and solutions to
  specific difficulties presented in the assignments.  These
  interactional categories illustrate the balance of
  socio-emotional comments that support the student. Best practice
  has revealed that this balance of comments maintains student
  motivation.  The tutor also can use a range of questions in a
  number of different ways, some to stimulate further reflection,
  but others to point out, in a nice way, that there are problems
  with part of an assignment.
</p>
<p>
  Open Mentor works by
  stripping out the tutor comments on an electronic assignment,
  applying a set of rules to these comments in order to put them
  into four major categories of Positive reactions, Teaching
  points, Questions and Negative reactions. It then provides
  feedback to the tutor about how their comments provide support
  to the tutor.

<h3>What can it tell you?</h3>

<h4>Comment analysis for a whole course </h4>
<p>
  Peter White is a tutor on a science course.  He sent all the
  student assignments to OpenMentor for analysis.  Then he
  asked used the course report to investigate his use of comments
  in the feedback to students on these assignments.
</p>
<p>
  OpenMentor produced a graph as shown below.
</p>
<table id="commentA_table_1-table" class="actual-ideal table table-striped table-condensed">
  <thead>
      <tr>
           <td></td>
           <th scope="col">Ideal</th>
           <th scope="col">Actual</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
	<tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>A</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>123</td><td class='bullet-actual'>92</td></tr>
	<tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>B</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>145</td><td class='bullet-actual'>121</td></tr>
	<tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>C</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>113</td><td class='bullet-actual'>139</td></tr>
	<tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>D</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>27</td><td class='bullet-actual'>23</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  The graph indicated that Peter had given rather fewer positive
  comments and teaching points that might be expected for the grades
  that he had given. He had also asked more questions than might
  be expected, although his use of negative comments was about
  in line.
</p>
<p>
  Peter could then explore the comments of each type in a little
  more detail, looking at each student's work individually, and
  considering whether his use of feedback needed a little refinement.
</p>

<h4>Explore differences within a course</h4>
<p>
  Karen Green is a tutor on a business course. After assessing
  the written work for five students, she used OpenMentor to
  compare the comment use for each student. OpenMentor produced
  four different graphs, one for each type of comment.
</p>
<p>
  For the teaching points (group B) OpenMentor produced a graph as shown below.
</p>
<table id="commentB_table_1-table" class="actual-ideal table table-striped table-condensed">
    <thead>
        <tr>
             <td></td>
             <th scope="col">Ideal</th>
             <th scope="col">Actual</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>09000031</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>14</td><td class='bullet-actual'>19</td></tr>
        <tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>09000032</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>10</td><td class='bullet-actual'>6</td></tr>
        <tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>09000033</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>14</td><td class='bullet-actual'>13</td></tr>
        <tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>09000034</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>18</td><td class='bullet-actual'>17</td></tr>
        <tr class='bullet'><td class='bullet-label'>09000035</td><td class='bullet-ideal'>18</td><td class='bullet-actual'>19</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  This graph illustrates that in the first assignment she gave more
  teaching points than expected for the mark awarded. However for the
  second student she gave less than expected. The other three were about
  right, i.e., there was very little distance from the ideal line.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of comments relating to teaching points by a business
  school tutor:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    'I was looking for ideas here e.g. discuss strategic issues
    (internal and external and then follow with some analysis of
    the external environment).'
  </li>
  <li>
    'In order to look at the long term suitability of the
    strategies a good starting point could be the strategic issues
    the company is facing'
  </li>
  <li>
    'It would have been appropriate here to have listed the main
    strategic issues facing the company'
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>The visual representation: bullet graphs</h4>

<p>
  OpenMentor uses a visual representation called "bullet graphs"
  designed by Stephen Few to make it easy to compare actual
  to ideal values. The actual count is shown by
  a solid bar, and the ideal count is shown by a small black line.
  When the bar and the line meet, the actual and ideal values are
  close. When there is enough data, OpenMentor shades the area
  around the ideal value -- anything in the shaded region is close
  enough to be considered normal. When the bar is outside the shaded
  region, either too far beyond the line (actual is a lot higher)
  or a long way short of the line (actual is a lot lower) this is
  worth investigating in more detail.
