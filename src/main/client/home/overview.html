  <h3>How does it work in practice?</h3>
  <p>
  Open Mentor provides tutors with guidance by analysing the
comments they make and grouping them in four major
categories.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Category A: Positive Reactions</li>
	<li>Category B: Teaching Points</li>
	<li>Category C: Questions</li>
	<li>Category D: Negative Reactions</li>
</ul>
